Rabate system
------------

What exactly rabate system is?
It's the library which can introduce to your application beings like:
 1. Basket
 2. CashDesk
 3. Rabates
 4. Tax rates

Rabate system has been written in PHP5.4.


Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~{.php}
foreach( $smth as $row ) {

}
~~~
